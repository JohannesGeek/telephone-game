# CDK Telephone

This is the repo for an interactive workshop at [CloudLand 2023](https://www.cloudland.org/)!


To run the slides, I use [RevealMD](https://github.com/webpro/reveal-md), install it and run

```
reveal-md slides.md --theme solarized
```

# Contribute!

In `workers`, there is an `js-example` and `py-example`. Copy the folders and rename them, but the new names need to start with `js` or `py` so my CDK stack knows which they are. The names of the files and names of the methods need to stay the same!

Then change the code inside the method to your liking, and change the message the way you want to. You can also use ChatGPT, have a look at workers/py-example-chatqpt

Have fun and ask me if you need help!
